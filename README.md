# relentless

relentless is a Python package for performing optimization using popular
molecular dynamics simulation engines, including LAMMPS and HOOMD-blue.
For example, relentless can be used to optimize the relative entropy
for structural coarse-graining or inverse design. However, relentless
is highly extensible and its features support generic reproducible
simulation workflows and optimization strategies.
